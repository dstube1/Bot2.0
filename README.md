# ARK Survival Ascended Gacha Bot

This project is a Python-based Gacha Bot for ASA. Its designed to use Y-Traps and a 2k ultrawide screen.

## Project Structure
- `assets/` - Some cool pictures^^
- `bot/` - Core bot logic and modules
- `calibration/` - Some random shit to automate click position calibration
- `config/` - Configuration files and settings
- `logs/` - An attempt of tracking some ressources produced and runtimes
- `scripts/` - Since no graphical interface or so, here I test the whole bot
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests

## FYI
This Bot is an absolute mess and most likely unusable for everyone. If you want to "use" it sure, but don´t bother me, I have no idea what I´ve done
